# Enhancing-E-Commerce-Agility-With-Advanced-ETL-Pipeline
## Project Overview
This project automates the processing of __orders__ and __returns__ data stored in an S3 bucket, performs transformations using AWS Glue, and orchestrates the workflow using AWS Step Functions. The processed data is then made available for visualization via a Streamlit application.

## Problem Statement
As a Data Engineer Your objective is to build an end-to-end automated data processing workflow that handles data uploads from the Order and Returns teams, performs a join operation using Glue & PySpark, stores the joined data in Redshift, and sends notifications about the pipeline's status using SNS. 

## Technologies used :
AWS Glue
pyspark
SNS
Step Funtion
S3
Data Catalog
Streamlit

## Project Workflow: End-to-End Data Pipeline

## Step 1: Data Upload via Streamlit
* Order team uploads __Order__ data file via Streamlit.
* Returns team uploads __Returns__ data file via Streamlit.
* Files are securely uploaded to their respective S3 buckets:
  * `ecommerce-orders-raw` for Order file
  * `ecommerce-returns-raw` for Return file
 
## Step 2: Lambda Trigger on S3 Upload
* Each file upload triggers an AWS Lambda function.
* Lambda:
   * Identifies which file was uploaded
   * Starts an AWS Glue ETL job both the order and return files are uploaded.

## Step 3: Data Processing with AWS Glue
* Glue ETL job performs:
  * Data extraction from S3 buckets
  * Data transformation using PySpark
  * Join operation on "Order ID" from both datasets.
* The final joined dataset is prepared.

## Step 4: Data Storage and Access
* The joined data is written to Data catalog instead of Redshift
* Teams can query the joined data

## Step 5: Orchestration with AWS Step Functions
* AWS Step Functions manages the full process:
  * Wait for file upload
  * Trigger Lambda
  * Launch Glue Job
  * Load data to Data catalog
  * Notify status
* Monitors each stage and handles errors or retries.

## Step 6: Status Display in Streamlit UI
* Streamlit shows pipeline execution status (Success or Failure).
* This gives real-time feedback to the teams after data upload.

## Step 7: Notifications via Amazon SNS
* After the pipeline finishes:
   * An SNS topic sends an email.
   * Subscribers receive the notification.
   * Email indicates whether the pipeline succeeded or failed.

}
```
## 2. Create S3 Buckets
* `ecommerce-orders-raw` - for order team uploads
* `ecommerce-returns-raw` - for returns team uploads
* `ecommerce-processed/joined-data` - for joined data
* `ecommerce-glue-scripts` - for PySpark scripts

**Configure S3 Triggers**
* Create the S3 event trigger `trigger-lambda-on-orders-upload` which automatically invokes your Lambda function `ecommerce-trigger-glue` whenever a new file is uploaded to the `ecommerce-orders-raw` bucket, which then starts your Glue ETL job to process the data.
*  Create the S3 event trigger `trigger-lambda-on-returns-upload` which automatically invokes your Lambda function `ecommerce-trigger-glue` whenever a new file is uploaded to the `ecommerce-returns-raw` bucket, which then starts your Glue ETL job to process the data.

            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
**Key features**
This AWS Lambda function is triggered when both Order and Returns files are uploaded to S3. It:
* Extracts S3 bucket and object key details from the event.
* Starts an AWS Glue job named "ecommerce_join_data" with the file locations and additional parameters like output database and table.
* Returns the Glue job run ID if successful, or an error message if something goes wrong.

            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

**Key features**
This AWS Lambda function checks whether the latest Order and Returns CSV files exist in their respective S3 buckets:
* It searches each bucket (ecommerce-orders-raw and ecommerce-returns-raw) for the most recent file.
* If both files exist, it returns their S3 bucket names and file keys.
* If either file is missing or inaccessible, it returns "both_exist": False.

Itâ€™s used as a pre-check before triggering the Glue ETL process.

                "arn:aws:glue:us-east-1:733015200604:database/default"
            ]
        },
```

**2.Glue PySpark Script**
This AWS Glue PySpark script performs an ETL job to join orders and returns data from S3 and save the result in Parquet format:
1. Reads input arguments (S3 buckets, keys, output database/table).
2. Loads CSV files from `ecommerce-orders-raw` and `ecommerce-returns-raw`
3. Validates required columns exist in both datasets.
4. Renames and transforms columns, converting date fields and adding source tags.
5. Joins the orders and returns on `order_id` (left join).
6. Adds a processing timestamp and writes the final data to `s3://ecommerce-processed/joined-data/` in Parquet format.
7. Commits the Glue job and logs success or failure.

## 5. Orchestration - Step Function
This AWS Step Functions state machine coordinates an automated ETL pipeline with file existence checks, retries, and notifications. Here's a simplified explanation of what it does:
1. ## Initialize Retry Counter
     * Starts the flow by initializing a retry counter to zero.
2. ## Check for Files
     * Invokes the Lambda function `check-orders-returns-exist` to verify if both the orders and returns files exist in S3.
3. ## Decision - FilesExist?
     * If both files exist â†’ move to trigger the Glue job.
     * If not and retry count < 5 â†’ wait 30 seconds, increment retry, and recheck.
     * If retry count â‰¥ 5 â†’ fail the execution.
4. ## Trigger Glue Job
     * If files are found, it calls another Lambda function ecommerce-trigger-glue to start the AWS Glue job.
5. ## Check Glue Job Status
     * After triggering, it periodically checks the status of the Glue job using the `check-glue-job-status` Lambda function.
6. ## Glue Job Status Check
     * If Glue job succeeds â†’ send success notification to SNS.
     * If fails â†’ send failure notification.
     * If still in progress â†’ wait 60 seconds and recheck.
7. ## Error Handling
     * Any failure in Lambda or Glue job triggers the HandleLambdaError state, which ultimately leads to a failure notification.
8. ## Notifications
     * SuccessNotification: Publishes a success message to the `etl-success-topic` SNS topic.
     * FailExecution: Publishes a failure message (with details like which file failed, Glue status, timestamp) to the `etl-failure-topic`.
9. ## Retry Logic Summary
     * Retries the file check up to 5 times, waiting 30 seconds between attempts, to handle delays in S3 uploads.

This Step Function automates ETL execution robustly, ensuring:

* It only runs the Glue job when both files are ready,
* It handles temporary file delays with retries,
* It monitors job success/failure,
* It notifies stakeholders via SNS.

## 6. StreamlitUI

Streamlit web app that allows users to:
* Upload orders and returns CSV files.
* Store them in AWS S3 buckets.
* Trigger an AWS Step Function to run an ETL pipeline.
* After success, it loads the processed, joined data from S3.
* Displays a preview and gives a download option.

**Tech Stack**
* Streamlit for web UI
* AWS S3 for file storage
* AWS Step Functions to trigger ETL
* AWS Glue for data processing
* Pandas to show the data

## Project Challenges
**1. Glue Job Output Not Appearing in S3**
## Challenge ##:
Joined data not visible in s3://ecommerce-processed/joined-data/ despite job success.

## Solution ##:
* __Verify the output path__ in your PySpark script:
```python
output_path = "s3://ecommerce-processed/joined-data/"  # Must match bucket
```
* __Check IAM permissions__:
Glue job role needs `s3:PutObject` on the target bucket.
Attach this policy:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": ["s3:PutObject"],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::ecommerce-processed/*"
  }]
}
```
**2. Event Trigger Not Invoking Lambda**
## Challenge:
Uploads to `ecommerce-orders-raw` donâ€™t trigger the Lambda.
## Solution:
* __Verify the S3 notification__:
```bash
aws s3api get-bucket-notification-configuration \
  --bucket ecommerce-orders-raw
```
* __Recreate the trigger if missing__
